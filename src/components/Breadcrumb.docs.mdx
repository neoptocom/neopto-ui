# Breadcrumb

The `Breadcrumb` component displays the current location within a hierarchy and optional navigation
links for parent levels. It supports icons, external links, and click handlers for in-app routing.

## When to use

- Help users understand where they are in a nested content structure.
- Offer a quick path back to previous sections without duplicating navigation in headers or sidebars.
- Pair with routed or client-side navigation; items accept either `href` or `onClick`.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Breadcrumb } from "@neoptocom/neopto-ui";

const items = [
  { label: "Home", href: "/" },
  { label: "Docs", href: "/docs" },
  { label: "Components" }
];

<Breadcrumb items={items} showHomeIcon />;
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BreadcrumbStories.Playground} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbStories.Playground} />

## Design guidance

- Keep labels short; truncate or abbreviate long section names where possible.
- Provide icons sparingly to reinforce key contexts (e.g., folders vs. people).
- Use `showHomeIcon` to reinforce a “home” entry without duplicating the label.
- Avoid mixing `href` and `onClick` handlers on the same item.

## Composing with state

Combine breadcrumb click handlers with your router or state machine to switch views without a full
page load. The interactive example demonstrates an in-app documents flow.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={BreadcrumbStories.InteractiveNavigation} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Breadcrumbs are wrapped in a `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` for screen readers.
- The final item receives `aria-current="page"` automatically.
- Clickable items expose keyboard handlers, so always keep labels descriptive.
