# Card

Cards provide glassmorphic containers for grouping content. They offer decorative borders, elevated
shadows, and an app-background variant that mirrors hero surfaces.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Card } from "@neoptocom/neopto-ui";

<Card>
  <h3>Weekly summary</h3>
  <p>Use cards to separate content into digestible surfaces.</p>
</Card>;
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.Playground} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={CardStories.Playground} />

## Variants

- `showDecorations` adds gradient strokes suited for marketing hero cards.
- `variant="app-background"` injects the NeoPTO hero artwork and auto-switches with theme.
- `elevated` applies a high-emphasis drop shadow—combine with default or app backgrounds.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.AppBackground} />
</Canvas>

## Layout tips

- Allow cards to breathe: default padding is `p-6`, override via the `className` prop for custom
  spacing.
- Stack cards in responsive grids to create dashboards or settings panels.
- Avoid nesting too many cards; use muted surfaces inside when grouping secondary information.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={CardStories.DashboardLayout} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Cards render as semantic `<div>` elements. Provide meaningful headings and maintain contrast ratios
when overlaying text on app backgrounds. For interactive cards, wrap focusable elements instead of
attaching click handlers to the card root.
