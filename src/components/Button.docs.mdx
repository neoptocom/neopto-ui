# Button

Buttons trigger primary user actions. They support three visual variants, three sizes, optional full
width layout, and icon affordances.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@neoptocom/neopto-ui";

<Button variant="primary" size="md">
  Save changes
</Button>;
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Playground} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={ButtonStories.Playground} />

## Variants

Use variants to communicate hierarchy:

- `primary`: main call to action.
- `secondary`: supporting actions with visual emphasis.
- `ghost`: low emphasis actions within already prominent surfaces.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Variants} />
</Canvas>

## Layout

- Aim for one primary button per view; demote additional actions to secondary/ghost.
- Combine icons with concise labels for quicker scanning.
- Apply `fullWidth` for responsive mobile layouts or wizard footers.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.FullWidthCallToAction} />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Buttons use semantic `<button>` elements with focus styles.
- Provide descriptive text even when using icons to ensure screen readers announce intent.
- Disable buttons sparingly—pair with helper text when an action is unavailable.
